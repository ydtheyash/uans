# UANS
UANS stands for Universal Asset Numbering Scheme

UANS's vision is to create a Structured Nomenclature and Systemise the Digital Assets Data across Web3, Metaverses, and Games.

In this MVP, we have deployed UANS contract on Four chains:

# UANS Algorithm

A = Chain Name + Chain ID + Contract Address + Token ID 

Eg.

https://dodas.xyz/assets/Azuki/ethereum/0xED5AF388653567Af2F388E6224dC7C4b3241C544/9999

Chain Name = ETH
Chain ID = 1
Contract Address = Azuki = 0xED5AF388653567Af2F388E6224dC7C4b3241C544
Token ID = 9999


Ad = ETH10xED5AF388653567Af2F388E6224dC7C4b3241C5449999

SHA 265 

Ae = 2a9498b37c1bb3c045cd4ac6050da6158fe541cd09e5b8fe33672ccde9acd8d4.doda


Ad is the RAW format of UANS and Ae is the encrypted format of UANS
